# Chronos-testing
Testing Chronos using GBM

Step 1 is to use fixed mu and sigma of GBM while adding a changing random noise.

Step 2 is to use fixed sigma but with mu changing the sign after a random changing point, along with the random noise.

Step 3 is to keep shifting the sign of mu in 4 consecutive +- pairs, similar to extend step 2 to 4 times the original length.
